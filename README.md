Recreating React

Ever wondered about the magic behind React’s curtain? What transforms that JSX jargon into delightful DOM nodes? How do hooks keep track of their state? I did, and that curiosity drove me to dive deep and recreate four of React’s core features:

    1. createElement — where JSX is transformed into ReactElement objects
    2. render — the process that brings ReactElements to life on the DOM
    3. useState — the cornerstone of state management in React
    4. useEffect — the lifecycle method that synchronizes your component with an external system
